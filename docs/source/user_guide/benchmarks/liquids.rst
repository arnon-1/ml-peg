Water ethanol density curves
=======

Summary
-------

Benchmark of the density of water-ethanol mixtures using NPT MD for different concentrations of ethanol, compare to experiment.


Metrics
-------

1. rms of the density difference.
2. rms of the excess volume difference.
3. Location of the minimal excess volume.


Data availability
-----------------
Input structures:
Packmol generated

Reference densities:
From: M. Southard and D. Green, Perry’s Chemical Engineers’ Handbook, 9th Edition. McGraw-Hill Education, 2018.

Computational cost
------------------

Very high - 1 ns of NPT MD on about 120 water/ethanol molecules, 7 times per model.
